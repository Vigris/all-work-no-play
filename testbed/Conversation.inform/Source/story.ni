Chapter - Back Room

The Back Room is a room. "This is an unused room behind the stocks. A spare guard uniform hangs from a hook on the wall. Aside from a [coffee table] and a [cheap metal chair], the room is unfurnished. [first time]

You're frog-marched inside and given a shove. Over the guard's shoulder, the cashier finishes looking through your handbag. She gives you a look of dripping contempt.

'Stay here. Phil will be back soon to take care of you,' the cashier sneers. 'You're in so much trouble, missy.' The guard just glowers. They file out, taking your handbag with them, and the door closes with an audible click.[paragraph break]After a few minutes, Phil returns alone. 'Sit,' he tells you. You get onto the cheap metal chair. Phil nods, although he still looks kind of angry.[paragraph break]'You damn punks. Think you can get away with anything, do ya?' Phil scowls. 'If it were up to me, I'd whip you all like your mommy shoulda. But today for some reason, [italic type]ooh[roman type], that'd be '[italic type]assault[roman type]'.' He leans forward. 'So I'm gonna give you a choice, girl. You can go to the station and wait for your parents to pick you up. I'm sure they'd love to hear all about that. Or you could take your punishment from me until I'm satisfied you've learnt your lesson.'[only] "

Section - Back room furniture

The coffee table is a fixed in place supporter in the Back Room. The description of the coffee table is "Cheap as it gets."
The cheap metal chair is a scenery supporter in the Back Room. It is enterable.
Does the player mean entering something enterable: it is likely.
Instead of exiting from the cheap metal chair during Rock_and_hard_place, say "One look at Phil's face convinces you not to try."
The player is on the chair.

Chapter - Player

The description of the player is "You have a bit of the pixie thing going, all wide eyes and fine-boned features. Together with your schoolgirl uniform and light makeup, that lends you a very sweet and innocent appearance."

The player wears a schoolgirl uniform. The description of the schoolgirl uniform is "A white blouse, a vest, thigh-length plaid skirt, and some shiny black shoes. All nice and proper." 
Instead of taking off the schoolgirl uniform, say "This is far too public for you to do that."

Chapter - Phil the Security Guard

Phil is a man in the Back Room. 
The description of Phil is "A big sandy-haired guy in a rumpled uniform. His heavy, unshaven face is set in a frown. He's currently looking at you with a faintly menacing expression." Understand "security" or "guard" as Phil. 
When play begins, now the current interlocutor is Phil.


Phil can be waiting-for-answer or just-shooting-the-breeze. Phil is just-shooting-the-breeze.

Chapter - The conversation

Rock_and_hard_place is a scene. Rock_and_hard_place begins when play begins.

punishment is a familiar thing. Understand "spanking" as punishment when Rock_and_hard_place is happening.
Phil can be candid-about-spanking.
After quizzing Phil about punishment for the first time:
	say "'Ok,' you say, trying to keep your voice from quavering. 'So what kinda punishment are you talking about?'[paragraph break]Phil purses his lips. 'I think we both know you have to learn some basic respect. I think a good spanking should straighten you out. Don't you?'[paragraph break]'What?' You're not sure if you heard him correctly.[paragraph break]'Twenty strokes,' Phil tells you. 'If you take your medicine, we'll forget about this.' He looks closer at your expression. 'The way you're carrying on, you've been spanked before, right?' [paragraph break]";
	now the printed name of punishment is "spanking";
	now punishment is improper-named;
	now Phil is candid-about-spanking;
	now Phil is waiting-for-answer.

To say (x - text) as Phil's punishment question:
	now Phil is just-shooting-the-breeze;
	say x.

After quizzing Phil about punishment, say "[one of]'Spanking?' You swallow. 'Like, you know..?'[paragraph break]'So now you're paying attention, huh? Yeah, you heard right. Betcha a dozen hard smacks will teach what happens to misbehaving brats. Or not.' He snorts. 'Anyway, you take your lumps with good grace, then nobody'll have to take this further. You'll be free to go.'[or]You don't think he's going to budge. Either a spanking, or to the station with you.[stopping]" as Phil's punishment question.

The block saying yes rule does nothing when Phil is waiting-for-answer.
The block saying no rule does nothing when Phil is waiting-for-answer.

Instead of doing anything other than saying yes or saying no while Phil is waiting-for-answer, say "You don't want to give him the satisfaction of an answer, so you don't.[paragraph break]Phil snorts. 'I guess that's what we call a silence that speaks volumes. Well, either way, it sounds like a lesson is way overdue.[if the player is decided-on-spanking]. Now get up[end if].'" as Phil's punishment question.

After saying yes while Phil is waiting-for-answer, say "'Yeah.' You bite your lip as you nod.[paragraph break]'I'm not surprised. Too bad you didn't learn from it,' Phil says. 'We'll do it right this time.[if the player is decided-on-spanking]. Now get up[end if].'" as Phil's punishment question.

After saying no while Phil is waiting-for-answer, say "'No,' you say, trying to sound brave.[paragraph break]'Figures. That's what's wrong with the country today, yanno. Kids without manners, cause nobody wants to teach them consequences. Well, sounds like a lesson is overdue[if the player is decided-on-spanking]. Now get up[end if].'" as Phil's punishment question.

Every turn during Rock_and_hard_place: say "[if Phil is waiting-for-answer][Phil] looks like he's expecting a reply.[otherwise][italic type]You can ask about [the station] or [the punishment]. Or you could choose either one[roman type].[end if] "
	
the police station is a familiar thing.
After quizzing Phil about the police station while Phil is not waiting-for-answer for the first time, say "Phil looks you over from head to toe. 'All you need to do is to walk out that door. Don't worry, I hear you can have a chance at clearing your record in five years, easy.'"
After quizzing Phil about the police station while Phil is not waiting-for-answer for the second time, say "'Don't worry, I'm sure your folks will be thrilled to hear what their little princess's been up to.'"
After quizzing Phil about the police station while Phil is not waiting-for-answer, say "'Won't mommy and daddy be proud when they pick you up.'"
After quizzing Phil about yourself while Phil is not waiting-for-answer, say "'I don't wanna hear it. You're just a snot-nosed brat who can't keep her fingers to herself.'"
Instead of saying sorry when Rock_and_hard_place is happening, try quizzing Phil about yourself.

Yourself can be undecided-on-spanking or decided-on-spanking. The player is undecided-on-spanking.

Instead of requesting Phil for the police station while the the location is the Back Room:
	say "'I'm...-' You pause, swallowing hard. Is this really what you want to do?[paragraph break](Y/N) ";
	if the player consents, choose dignity above expedience;
	otherwise say "'...let me think about it,' you finish, lamely."

To choose dignity above expedience: 
	say "'[if Phil is candid-about-spanking]Screw you, I'm not playing your sick games[otherwise]I think it'd be best if I just get this over with[end if],' you tell him. 'Take me to the station[if Phil is candid-about-spanking] already[otherwise], please[end if].'[paragraph break]Outside, in the corridor, you collect your things under Phil's watchful gaze. The walk through the shop seems eternal. There's at least ten customers in the store, every one of them staring. Phil has to give you a push to get you moving. At least he didn't have you handcuffed, right?[paragraph break]As you step onto the tarmac, you realize this is actually happening. The parking lot looms before you.[paragraph break][if Phil is candid-about-spanking]Sure, you weren't about to let this creep lay his hands on your ass[otherwise]True, the whole thing about punishment was weird, and what you did [italic type]was[roman type] wrong[end if].[paragraph break]But still... maybe, just maybe, this was a mistake.";
	end the story saying "The End".

Instead of going outside in the Back Room: choose dignity above expedience.

Instead of requesting Phil for punishment while Rock_and_hard_place is happening:
	say "'All right,' you tell him. 'I'll choose, uh, punishment.'[paragraph break]'Hmpf. Thought you might. But you have to ask for it.'[paragraph break]'Okay. Uhm. Please [if Phil is candid-about-spanking]spank[otherwise]punish[end if] me, Mister.'[paragraph break]'All right. Get on your feet.'";
	now the player is decided-on-spanking;
	if Phil is not candid-about-spanking, try quizzing Phil about punishment.

Rock_and_hard_place ends when yourself is decided-on-spanking.

Understand "select [any known thing]" as implicit-requesting when Rock_and_hard_place is happening.
Understand "pick [any known thing]" as implicit-requesting when Rock_and_hard_place is happening.
