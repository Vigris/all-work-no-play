Chapter - Back Room

The Back Room is a room. "This is an unused room behind the stocks. A spare guard uniform hangs from a hook on the wall. Aside from a [coffee table] and a [cheap metal chair], the room is unfurnished. [first time]

You're frog-marched inside and given a shove. Over the guard's shoulder, the cashier finishes looking through your handbag. She gives you a look of dripping contempt.

'Stay here. Phil will be back soon to take care of you,' the cashier sneers. 'You're in so much trouble, missy.' The guard just glowers. They file out, taking your handbag with them, and the door closes with an audible click.[paragraph break]After a few minutes, Phil returns alone. 'Sit,' he tells you. You get onto the cheap metal chair. Phil nods, although he still looks kind of angry.[paragraph break]'You damn punks. Think you can get away with anything, do ya?' Phil scowls. 'If it were up to me, I'd whip you all like your mommy shoulda. But today for some reason, [italic type]ooh[roman type], that'd be '[italic type]assault[roman type]'.' He leans forward. 'So I'm gonna give you a choice, girl. You can go to the station and wait for your parents to pick you up. I'm sure they'd love to hear all about that. Or you could take your punishment from me until I'm satisfied you've learnt your lesson.'[only] "

The player is on the chair.

Chapter - Player

The description of the player is "You have a bit of the pixie thing going, all wide eyes and fine-boned features. Together with your schoolgirl uniform and light makeup, that lends you a very sweet and innocent appearance."

The player wears a schoolgirl uniform. The description of the schoolgirl uniform is "A white blouse, a vest, thigh-length plaid skirt, and some shiny black shoes. All nice and proper." 
Instead of taking off the schoolgirl uniform, say "This is far too public for you to do that."

Chapter - Phil the Security Guard

Phil is a man in the Back Room. 
The description of Phil is "A big sandy-haired guy in a rumpled uniform. His heavy, unshaven face is set in a frown. He's currently looking at you with a faintly menacing expression." Understand "security" or "guard" as Phil. 

Phil can be waiting-for-answer or just-shooting-the-breeze. Phil is just-shooting-the-breeze.

Chapter - The conversation

punishment is a familiar thing.
Rock_and_hard_place is a scene. Rock_and_hard_place begins when play begins.
After quizzing Phil about punishment:
	say "'Ever been spanked, little bitch?'";
	now Phil is waiting-for-answer.

After of doing anything other than saying yes or saying no while Phil is waiting-for-answer:
	now Phil is just-shooting-the-breeze;	
	say "'I guess that's what we call a silence that speaks volumes.'"
	
After saying yes while Phil is waiting-for-answer: 
	now Phil is just-shooting-the-breeze;
	say "'I thought as much. What a slut.'"
	
After saying no while Phil is waiting-for-answer: 
	now Phil is just-shooting-the-breeze;
	say "'I didn't think so. Well, this is gonna hurt then.'"


Every turn during Rock_and_hard_place: say "[if Phil is waiting-for-answer]You get the sense it's a rhetorical question.[otherwise]The topics are...[end if] "
