Book - The Game World

Part - Opening crawl

When play begins, say "So it's a boring day at school, and you'd much rather be out shopping and having fun. Problem is, dear old dad has cut you off. In short, you're broke. No cute shoes or awesome crop tops for you! And there was a sale on, too...

Then again, you're nothing if not resourceful. You were sure there'd be an awesome deal at the mall. So one quick hop over the fence, then over to the bus, and boom!

This is gonna be great, you can tell."


Part - Mall Region

Chapter - Mall court

Mall Court is a room. "This is the Oak Hills mall, your first and last stop for the high life. A sprawling concourse of stucco and marble and escalators, teeming with shoppers.

That new store to the west is open."

Chapter - New Shop

The New Shop is west of the Mall Court. "Nothing beats a newly opened store trying its best to beat the competition. Obvious concessions to new customers aside, you kinda like what you see on the racks: varied selections ranging from cute to racy to alternative. Decent quality too, although some of it does look kinda pricey. Lots of customers with more money than you are busily queuing up before [the cashier]."

This is the shoplifter caught stage-setting rule:
	now the player is in the Back Room;
	now Phil is proper-named;
	now the handbag is off-stage;
	now Phil is identified.

Section - Makeup stand

The makeup stand is in the Shop. "The makeup stand [if the player is close-to-the-makeup]next to you[otherwise]nearby[end if] advertises your favorite brand[first time]. Wow, you'd really look awesome in those colors[only][if the beauty box is on the stand]. You see the [beauty box] there, beckoning[end if]." The stand is a fixed in place supporter.

The description of the stand is "The advert is for Shameless, your brand of choice. Normally you'd want to browse, but there's a beauty box marked with a beautiful swirl of stars: it's got nail polish, foundation, primers, mascara, lip gloss, assorted brushes... everything a girl might need."

Yourself can be close-to-the-makeup.

Before doing something with the stand when the player is not close-to-the-makeup:
	say "You sidle up to the stand. [run paragraph on]";
	now the player is close-to-the-makeup.

Section - Beauty box

The beauty box is a container. The description is "Still in its shiny packaging. It looks amazing, and it [if we have taken the beauty box]will[otherwise]would[end if] make [italic type]you[roman type] look amazing."
After examining the stand for the first time:
	now the beauty box is on the stand;
	continue the action.

Instead of inserting the beauty box into the handbag when Phil is attentive, say "Not while the security guy is looking at you."
After inserting the beauty box into the handbag, say "You casually do your best to wrangle the beauty box into your handbag. It's a really narrow fit. You struggle for an instant, your eyes on the security guard, praying he'll stay put.

[italic type]There[roman type]. It's in. You lower your hand and pretend to study a nearby potted plant just as he turns toward you."

Instead of trying opening the beauty box when the location is the New Shop, say "They're not gonna let you open the merchandise until you've paid for it."
Instead of taking the beauty box when the box is in the handbag, say "You're committed now. You've got this."
Instead of going east from the New Shop when the player carries the beauty box, say "You take a few confident steps toward the cashier, box in your hand, before realizing you don't have any money to pay for it."
Instead of going east from the New Shop when the beauty box is in the handbag:
	say "You stroll toward the exit, feeling rather than seeing the security guard go on his way. You reach the arch, pass between them, and you're...-[paragraph break]'Hey you!' The cashier's pointing at you, ugly suspicion on her face. 'Lemme see that bag, huh?'[paragraph break]Well, [italic type]fuck[roman type].";
	follow the shoplifter caught stage-setting rule;
	Phil returns to administer punishment in 3 turns from now.


Chapter - Back Room

The Back Room is a room. "This is an unused room behind the stocks. A spare guard uniform hangs from a hook on the wall. Aside from a [coffee table] and a [cheap metal chair], the room is unfurnished[first time].

You're frog-marched inside and given a shove. Over the guard's shoulder, the cashier finishes looking through your handbag. She gives you a look of dripping contempt.

'Stay here. Phil will be back soon to take care of you,' the cashier sneers. 'You're in so much trouble, missy.' The guard just glowers. They file out, taking your handbag with them, and the door closes with an audible click[only]."

But today for some reason, [italic type]ooh[roman type], that'd be '[italic type]assault[roman type]'.' He leans forward. 'So I'm gonna give you a choice, girl. You can go to the station and wait for your parents to pick you up. I'm sure they'd love to hear all about that. Or you could take your punishment from me until I'm satisfied you've learnt your lesson.'"

Instead of exiting from the cheap metal chair during Rock_and_hard_place, say "[if Sit_down_bitch ended coercively]Phil has already shown he's ready and willing to force you down if he feels like it[otherwise]One look at Phil's face convinces you not to try[end if]."

You don't get to do that,' you exclaim. [paragraph break]Phil scoffs. 'Don't tell me you never been spanked?'[or]Like I said, you need a good ass-whoopin['] to teach you some respect, girl.'[stopping][line break]>";
	if the player consents, say "'Really?' He raises his eyebrows. 'I guess some kids just don't learn the first time.'";
